# Project Description

Brew Buddy is an app designed to help any coffee business achieve higher levels of customer satisfaction and therefore higher sales by helping users get better acquainted with that company's products faster. This android app takes in basic user preferences and translates them to recommended products on a menu, taking out much of the longer decision-making process that stops users from getting more complicated (and therefore more expensive) drinks. 

This app helps improve the customers' experience with the business by recommending products that fit what the user likes, and may not have even known was on the menu, as well as helping the business get the customer familiar and comfortable shopping with recommended options at their store, making them more likely to come back due to the personalized experience.

Much like Amazon’s recommendation features, which according to an article by McKinsey and Company, account for 35% of what people buy on Amazon, this app’s idea was developed to create a simple version of a recommendation feature that smaller businesses could attach to their mobile apps in order to boost sales. 

Also, it was just a fun idea to develop to see how this would all work together on a smaller scale. As mentioned in the “Possible Features Addition” this app could be easily extended to include food by just replacing the algorithm choices, making it a great template to use for any list of items a smaller store might be wanting to sell.
